# PDF RAG System

This repository contains the code for the PDF RAG System, a project designed to enable users to query a PDF document. The system works in two steps: 
1. Load the PDF document.
2. Query the PDF document.
   
Users can upload a PDF file and then ask questions. The questions will be answered using the context taken from the PDF document only.
